### Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is a touchy subject. In principle, it's very simple: a subclass that inherits from more than one 
parent class is able to access functionality from both of them. In practice, this is less useful than it sounds and many 
expert programmers recommend against using it.

As a rule of thumb, if you think you need multiple inheritance, you're probably wrong, but if you know you need it, you'are probably right.
